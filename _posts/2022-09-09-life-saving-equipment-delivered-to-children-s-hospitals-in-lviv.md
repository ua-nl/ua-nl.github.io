Thanks to the generosity of caring sponsors and the
efforts of dedicated volunteers, *the* *Ukrainians in the Netherlands
Foundation* has delivered **life-saving medical equipment** to four
children's hospitals in **Lviv** in the West of Ukraine.

In cooperation with the **Public Initiative \"Let's Help Together\"**,
we provided the hospitals with **infusion pumps** --- devices that
ensure the accurate and controlled administration of medicines, which
are essential in intensive care and recovery processes.

The equipment has already been installed and is actively helping young
patients on their journey to recovery.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to:\
-- Our generous sponsors in the Netherlands, whose support makes such
missions possible\
-- Our reliable partners at *\"Let's Help Together\"*, whose
collaboration is key to delivering aid where it's needed most

Together, we are saving lives and giving Ukrainian children a chance at
a healthy future.
