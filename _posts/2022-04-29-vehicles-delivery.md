On April 29, 2022, another vital humanitarian shipment was successfully
dispatched to support those affected by the war in Ukraine.

The aid convoy included vehicles loaded with urgently needed supplies:\
-- **Medicines and medical equipment\
**-- **Food and baby formula\
**-- **Medical stretchers for emergency response\
**-- **Two mobile tents for providing first aid in field conditions**

These resources are critical for saving lives and supporting civilians
and responders in frontline areas. Every delivery is a step closer to
easing suffering and standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

We are deeply grateful to everyone who contributed to making this
mission possible.

**Glory to Ukraine!**
