In April 2022 in a heartfelt show of support, MBO SintLucas in Boxtel
organised a successful solidarity campaign to aid civilians suffering
from the brutal consequences of the war in Ukraine. The initiative, held
at the height of Russia's full-scale invasion, gathered essential aid
and raised awareness among the local Dutch community.

The campaign was made possible thanks to the unwavering commitment of
students, staff, and organisers who worked together to collect
humanitarian assistance for people affected by the war. The action not
only provided critical support to Ukrainians but also fostered a strong
spirit of international solidarity.

The Foundation Ukrainians in the Netherlands extends its sincere
appreciation to everyone involved in this meaningful effort.

We would like to express special gratitude to:

-- Vivian van Lier, the key inspiration behind the initiative, whose
leadership and empathy brought it to life.

-- Vadim Koopmans, a dedicated volunteer whose tireless work ensured the
campaign's success and smooth delivery of aid.

Your actions speak louder than words. Thank you for standing with
Ukraine.
