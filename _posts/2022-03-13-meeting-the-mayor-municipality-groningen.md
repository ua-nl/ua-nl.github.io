We had a meeting with the mayor of the Municipality of Groningen and with the Ukrainian ambassador Maksym Kononenko during the Ukrainian Solidarity Event.
We discussed the current situation in Ukraine. Among other things, the shelters for displaced people, their guidance and possible integration into Dutch society were discussed. Our goals are humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as support for the people who arrive here. We have prepared a proposal to help forced migrants from Ukraine. We have also offered a platform where children and their parents can get acquainted with the Dutch language and culture. The "Ukrainians in the Netherlands" Foundation seeks to join in solving student problems and expanding possible connections with the Dutch labor market.

There was also an opportunity to talk with psychologists about the tragedy people suffered as a result of events in Ukraine.
