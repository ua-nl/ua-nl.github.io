Spring 2022 â€” Another shipment of humanitarian aid from the Netherlands has reached those in need in Ukraine.
This time, essential supplies were distributed in the border villages of Shostka district and in the towns of Hlukhiv and Putyvl in Sumy region, one of the areas most affected by the ongoing Russian aggression.

The initiative was carried out by the Ukrainians in the Netherlands
Foundation in close partnership with the Ukrainian charitable foundation
"Dobryn", with the generous support of sponsors and donors from the
Netherlands.

We are deeply grateful to everyone who helped make this mission
possible. Your solidarity is saving lives.

As part of the delivery, we also shared a heartfelt letter from our
Dutch sponsors to the people of Ukraine:

***\"Dear Ukrainian friend,***

***What is happening in your country, to your people, is terrible beyond
words.***

***We are a family and group of friends from the Netherlands who want to
support you and your family. It may seem far away, but we are close in
spirit --- we care deeply and wish only the best for Ukraine.***

***We hope the war ends immediately, that Russian forces leave your
homeland, and that Ukraine becomes part of the European Union.***

***We wish for you a peaceful life in a free and democratic Ukraine.***

***May the world stand with you, your country, and your armed forces ---
now and in the future.***

***You are in our thoughts. We are with you.***

***Warm greetings and hugs,***

***Frank's family: Jeroen, Alex, Lisa, Anna... and friends.\"***

Together, we stand for peace, freedom, and Ukraine.

***-- June 6, 2022***
