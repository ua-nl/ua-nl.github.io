Since its founding in 2014, the Foundation Ukrainians in the Netherlands
has remained steadfast in its mission to support Ukraine. Over the past
year --- amidst Russia's unprecedented and brutal full-scale invasion
--- our work has become more urgent than ever.

In 2022 alone, the foundation raised an incredible €1,400,000 and
delivered nearly 600,000 kilograms of humanitarian aid directly to those
most in need across Ukraine. These life-saving efforts were made
possible through the generous contributions of:

-- Members of the Ukrainian diaspora

-- Compassionate Dutch citizens

-- Our international friends and supporters

Every donation --- whether financial or material --- has played a
critical role in protecting lives, supporting families, and bringing
hope where it is needed most.

We are deeply grateful to everyone who stood with us and continues to
believe in a free and sovereign Ukraine. Your solidarity fuels our
efforts.

Together with our allies and partners, the Foundation Ukrainians in the
Netherlands will continue to do everything in its power to bring Ukraine
closer to victory, restore its territorial integrity, and help secure a
future of peace and prosperity for both Ukraine and all of Europe.

Let us keep fighting --- and we will overcome.
