18 December 2022 --- This year, Christmas preparations feel different.
While many are decorating homes and planning celebrations, our community
continues to stand with Ukraine through meaningful action.

On the eve of the holidays, the Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation
organised a volunteer initiative focused on packing first aid kits for
those in need in Ukraine. These kits are essential on the frontlines and
in war-affected regions, where access to urgent medical care can be
limited.

ðŸŽ„ Though the season is traditionally about giving, this year we give
not only to our loved ones --- but to those whose lives may depend on
it. ðŸŽ„

You can still support our efforts:

Donations welcome via:

Stichting OekraÃ¯ners in Nederland

IBAN: NL97 INGB 0006 5104 66

(ANBI registered: 853747945 -- tax-deductible in the Netherlands)

Thank you to everyone who continues to make a difference. Together, we
are sending hope, healing, and strength.
