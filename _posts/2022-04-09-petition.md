Ukraine is an integral part of Europe culturally, geographically, and historically. However, our country was not part of the European Union due to the specifics of the events of the past decades. Nevertheless, we have an opportunity to change it now. The leaders of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovakia have already claimed their support. But the Netherlands is still not on this list. So we're calling on you to help promote the accelerated accession of Ukraine to the EU. You can do it by signing the petition from our foundation using this link: [https://petities.nl/petitions/versneld-eu-lidmaatschap-voor-oekraine](https://petities.nl/petitions/versneld-eu-lidmaatschap-voor-oekraine)
Make your contribution to a peaceful European future for Ukraine! üôèüèº Sign the petition and share the link with everybody who wants to support Ukraine.
