Foundation and representatives of the Crimean Tatar community, we
successfully purchased and delivered essential equipment to support
Ukrainian defenders.

This equipment has been delivered to the area, where reliable power
supply is critical for maintaining communications, operations, and
safety.

💰 Financial Report:

📌 Funding Source:

These items were purchased using donations collected during the Embassy
Festival held on 7 September 2024 in The Hague.

We extend heartfelt thanks to Mykhailo and Vasyl for their free and
prompt delivery. Your contribution goes far beyond logistics --- it is
real and timely help for those protecting our country.

Together, we stand with Ukraine. Every action counts.

Crimea is Ukraine!
