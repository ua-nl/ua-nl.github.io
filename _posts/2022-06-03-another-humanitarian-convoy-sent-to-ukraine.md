*April 2022* --- *Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation* has
successfully delivered another round of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

This time, the convoy included:\
-- **Three minibuses and one BMW X5 (4x4)\
**-- **Medicines and food supplies\
**-- **Protective gear, including helmets and other safety equipment\
**-- **Three mobile tents/field hospitals for first aid in frontline
conditions**

These supplies will help support both civilians and defenders in areas
affected by the war. Mobile tents are especially important for providing
emergency medical care in regions with limited access to healthcare
infrastructure.

We remain committed to helping Ukraine and standing by those who protect
it.

**Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!\
All for Ukraine 🇺🇦🙏🇳🇱❤️**
