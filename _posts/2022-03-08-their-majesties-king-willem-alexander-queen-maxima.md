On 8 March,  representatives of the Ukrainian community in the Netherlands had the honor of meeting with Their Majesties King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

We are deeply grateful for this gesture of solidarity and opportunity to share our personal stories. During this special meeting, we expressed our deepest gratitude for the support currently being provided by the Netherlands.
We also appealed once again to Their Majesties to do everything possible to maintain the attention of Dutch society on the horrific events  in Ukraine, and to stop the terrible aggression of the Russian Federation and restore peace.
