From 24 February to 24 August 2023, the Ukrainians in the Netherlands
Foundation continued its unwavering mission to support Ukraine during
one of the most challenging periods in its modern history.

As the war persists, so does our determination to bring relief and hope
to those affected. We know this is a long and difficult fight --- but
together, we move forward, step by step, toward victory.

Thanks to the generosity of our community and partners, we raised an
impressive €120,000 during this six-month period, which allowed us to
deliver the following humanitarian aid:

* 📦 4,043 kg of essential items for displaced persons
* 🐾 2,113 kg of pet supplies
* 🧴 526 kg of hygiene products
* 👚 1,880 kg of clothing
* 🍏 5,968 kg of food
* 🧸 348 kg of children\'s goods
* 💻 1,817 electronic devices
* 💊 6,900 kg of medicines
* 🚗 4 vehicles for aid transport and field use

These deliveries have brought concrete help and hope to thousands of
Ukrainians --- from families in need to frontline volunteers.

We are immensely grateful to everyone who made this possible. But there
is still so much more to do.

👉 We invite everyone who cares about Ukraine to join our mission ---
donate, organise a fundraiser, or help us deliver aid. Every action
counts. Every effort brings us closer to peace.

Let us keep fighting --- and we will overcome. 🇺🇦

Together, we are stronger.
