It's always touching to see humanitarian aid being put in use in Ukraine!
Clothing, childrenâ€™s goods, hygiene items collected by Ukrainians in The Netherlands Foundation were distributed by center of social assistance in village Volodarka of Bila Tserkva district in Kyiv region.
Currently, this region hosts lots of displaced people that have fled their homes due to the war.

We want to thank all volunteers and donors. The support is crucial for Ukrainian people during these difficult times.
