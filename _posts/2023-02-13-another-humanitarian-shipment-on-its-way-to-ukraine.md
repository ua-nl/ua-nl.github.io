Winter 2022 --- Another truck loaded with humanitarian aid from the
Netherlands is now on its way to Ukraine. This mission is a continued
testament to the solidarity, strength, and resilience of our
international community.

The aid includes essential supplies for those affected by the war and
will be distributed to regions in urgent need.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed with
donations, time, and effort.

A special word of gratitude goes to the dedicated volunteers who helped
load the shipment in Rotterdam, Nijmegen, and Groningen --- your
commitment makes it all possible.

You are strong. You are unbreakable. You are true heroes. ❤️

With God's blessing --- and with love, from the Netherlands to Ukraine.

Thank you for standing with us.
