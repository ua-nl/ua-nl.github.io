The Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation has donated a
state-of-the-art automated blood culture system (bacteriological
hemocultivator) worth ‚Ç¨17,500 to the Chernivtsi Regional Children's
Clinical Hospital (–û–ö–ù–ü \"–ß–µ—Ä–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ü—å–∫–∞ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∞ –¥–∏—Ç—è—á–∞ –∫–ª—ñ–Ω—ñ—á–Ω–∞
–ª—ñ–∫–∞—Ä–Ω—è\").

ü©∏ This automated bacteriological hemocultivator is one of the core
diagnostic tools for multidisciplinary hospitals. It plays a vital role
in improving the quality and efficiency of medical care, reducing the
number of complications and lowering mortality rates among patients with
sepsis and fevers of unknown origin.

The device works by analysing blood samples where, in severe infections,
microorganisms may multiply. Its use allows for the rapid diagnosis of
sepsis in young patients, enabling doctors to prescribe timely and
effective treatment.

-- The pathogen can be detected within the first 24 hours of testing.

-- A negative result is confirmed by day 5.

-- In contrast, manual diagnosis can take up to 10 days --- meaning this
system cuts diagnostic time in half.

This life-saving technology will directly impact the lives of vulnerable
children in the region --- and we are proud to support Ukrainian
healthcare institutions with such critical tools.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to our generous donors and to Alena Boer,
whose support helped make this delivery possible.

Together, we save lives. Together, we support Ukraine.
