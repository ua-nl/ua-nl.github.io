10 March 2024 --- Over the course of one year, from 24 February 2023 to
24 February 2024, the Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation has
continued its dedicated work to support Ukrainians affected by Russia's
full-scale invasion.

In that time, we successfully raised €185,040 and delivered thousands of
kilograms of urgently needed humanitarian aid to families, frontline
responders, and vulnerable communities across Ukraine.

Thanks to the generosity of our donors and partners, we were able to
send:

* 🛍️ 7,454 kg of essential items for displaced persons
* 🐶 3,079 kg of pet supplies
* 🧴 1,177 kg of hygiene products
* 👚 4,081 kg of clothing
* 🍏 9,112 kg of food
* 🧸 1,212 kg of children's goods
* 💻 2,372 electronic devices
* 💊 14,567 kg of medicines
* 🚗 12 vehicles for transporting aid and saving lives

We are proud of what has been achieved --- but we know the work is far
from over.

🕊️ This is a long and difficult battle, but together we move steadily
forward toward victory.

👉 We invite everyone who cares about Ukraine to join us --- by
donating, volunteering, or helping spread the word. Every action
matters. Every voice counts.

Together, we are stronger. Let us keep fighting --- and we will
overcome. 🇺🇦
