The Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation continues to deliver
humanitarian aid to Ukraine --- not only through donations from
compassionate members of the Ukrainian diaspora, Dutch citizens, and
international supporters, but also thanks to the generous contributions
of our partner organisations.

We are especially grateful to Catharina Ziekenhuis in Eindhoven for
their ongoing support of medical professionals in Ukrainian hospitals
and frontline stabilisation points.

Together, we recently delivered vital medical equipment to the
frontlines in Donbas, including:

-- X-ray machines

-- Heart-lung bypass systems

-- A surgical operating table

-- Rehabilitation equipment

We also extend heartfelt thanks to our brave friend and Ukrainian
defender Ihor Prokaza, who ensured the safe delivery of this equipment
to frontline areas.

Our gratitude also goes out to the many volunteers who made this mission
possible --- your work saves lives.

Importantly, this is not a one-time act of support. Our cooperation with
Catharina Ziekenhuis is becoming increasingly systematic. In previous
shipments, we have also been able to send:

-- Electrosurgical equipment

-- Systems for amputation and coagulation

-- Disposable medical supplies

-- Advanced wound care systems and infusion solutions

-- Clothing and care items for the wounded

We are proud of what we've achieved together --- and hopeful that this
partnership will continue to grow.

With every delivery, we are helping save lives and bringing Ukraine one
step closer to victory. ðŸ’™ðŸ’›
