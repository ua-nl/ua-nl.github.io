    We source large quantities of medical supplies and protective equipment. Buying these items in bulk lowers their purchase price, makes
    transportation more efficient and allows us to meet the mounting needs of Ukrainians.
    However, it requires substantial financial resources. Your contribution can help us to continue providing much-needed aid to Ukraine.
