      - Medical supplies: CAT or SOF tourniquets, IFAK first-aid kits, Celox powder;
      - Food: dried and canned food, chocolate, energy and dried fruit bars, baby food;
      - Electronics: pocket torches, battery packs, power banks;
      - Clothing: men’s socks, khaki-coloured T-shirts, belts;
