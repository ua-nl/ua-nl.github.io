    Relief efforts encompass the procurement, collection and transport of urgently needed medical supplies, protective equipment, and humanitarian aid. Follow us for regular updates on goods accepted. The current priorities can be found here:

    We are currently seeking financial assistance for humanitarian aid and refugee relief. Before the most-recent Russian invasion, the Ukrainian economy was losing USD 3 billion per month as a result of the ongoing war in the Donbas, and now losses have tripled, at a minimum. Your organization‚Äôs financial support can help compensate for this deficit.

    However, humanitarian goods such as baby and hygiene products as well as medication are as urgently needed as financial support. This also applies to food products. Therefore, please consider donating such goods, as we are grateful to accept all assistance.
