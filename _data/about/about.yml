    We facilitate the integration of Ukrainians living in the Netherlands into Dutch society, while helping them to preserve their distinct identity, language, culture, and religious traditions for future generations.

    Our foundation also aims to provide continuous support and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, especially to areas most affected by Russian occupation and aggression.

    Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation is a non-profit organization established during the Euromaidan Uprising in 2014.
    Since then, our foundation has become a point of reference and connection for the Ukrainian-Dutch diaspora, and has also been providing
    support for and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. From the moment the Russian Federation unjustly invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022,
    our foundation has been at forefront of urgent humanitarian assistance for Ukrainian civilians and the Armed Forces of Ukraine,
    as well as support for refugees and displaced persons in the Netherlands.
