  title: Objective
  content: >
    The Foundation of Ukrainians in the Netherlands has as its main goal the promotion of the
    integration of the Ukrainian community within Dutch society while preserving and passing on their
    unique cultural identity, language, traditions, and religious values to future generations. The
    foundation places emphasis on supporting Ukrainians, both in the Netherlands and in Ukraine, with
    special attention to areas heavily affected by the war.


    An essential aspect of the foundation's activities is the provision of humanitarian aid. This includes
    coordinating essential medical supplies, protective equipment, and other forms of assistance, both to
    civilians and to the Ukrainian armed forces. In addition, the foundation also supports displaced
    persons and refugees through informational aid, mental health support, translation services, and
    humanitarian assistance.


    Furthermore, the foundation is dedicated to promoting cultural exchange and education. This is
    achieved by organizing events such as film screenings, exhibitions, concerts, seminars, festivals, art
    events, literary evenings, and creative masterclasses. These activities serve not only to celebrate and
    share Ukrainian culture but also to raise awareness and understanding of the Ukrainian situation
    within the Dutch community.


    Finally, the foundation aims for transparency and efficiency in its financial activities by fundraising
    and using funds responsibly and efficiently for its humanitarian and cultural projects. With a growing
    team of dedicated volunteers and the support of the community, the Foundation of Ukrainians in the
    Netherlands tirelessly works towards achieving these objectives, with the ultimate goal of bridging
    the gap between the Dutch and Ukrainian communities and making a positive impact on the lives of many people.
