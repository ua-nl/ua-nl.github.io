title: Who We Are
content: >
  The Ukrainians in the Netherlands Foundation is a registered non-profit organization founded in 2014 to support the needs of the Dutch Ukrainian diaspora. In close cooperation with the Ukrainian Embassy in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND), and top-tier international organizations, we are tirelessly working to counter the horrific consequences of the Russian invasion.

  We are a community of dedicated volunteers who care deeply about Ukraine and its people. Our team of 300 advocates with diverse professional backgrounds are helping those who fled the war, those who remain in Ukraine, and the heroic Armed Forces of Ukraine.
